description: This is the assessment that is performed on every patient.
---

## 🥇 First Steps

1. Come in, knock on the door, and introduce yourself.
2. Tell them you’re going to do a head-to-toe assessment.
3. Perform hand hygiene.
4. Check arm band to make sure you have the correct patient.

## 🙋‍♀️ Initial Questions

Once you have finished preparing, then you will ask the following questions;

1. “What is your first and last name?”
2. “What is your date of birth?”
3. “Can you tell me where you are at?”
4. "What is todays date in month, date, and year"

If the patient answered all of them correctly, they are alert and oriented x3.

## 🚦 Vital Signs

Collect the following vital signs;

1. blood pressure,
2. temperature,
3. oxygen saturation,
4. Check All Pules Sites

## 💾 Data Collection

While taking the vitals, observe the patient for the following;

1. **Responsiveness** - Is there a delay whenever they respond to me?
2. **Understanding** - Do they understand my questions and can they hear them clearly?
3. **Emotional Status** - Are they calm, distressed, agitated, drowsy, etc?
4. **Skin Color** - Does it match their ethnicity?
5. **Skin Feel** - Is their skin cold, clammy, or sweaty?
6. **Speech Pattern** - Is the patient slurring?
7. **Abnormalities** - Are there amputations, masses, lesions, etc?
8. **Respiratory distress** - Are they wheezing?
9. **Gait & Posture** - You should notice this when you walk in.
10. **Cleanliness & Smell** - Notice their cleanliness or abnormal smells.
11. **Memory** (Recent and remote)

- Recent memory: in the last 6 months. Give them 3 words to remember
- Remote memory: further back. Have a family member to verify info

## 🦴 Bony Prominences

You will need to check all of the bony prominences to ensure that they are intact and show no skin breakdown.

1. Occipital area
2. Shoulders
3. Elbows
4. Wrists
5. Lumbar sacral
6. Hips
7. Knees
8. Ankles
9. Check in between the fingers and toes for any skin break down

Once you have verified that everything looks good, you can say "bony prominences are intact and show no skin breakdown."

## Facial Features

1. Start to look at the skin color, make sure it is nice and pink
2. Make sure that the head is symmetrical and appropriate size for body
3. Looking for any abnormal movements or twitching of the face that are involuntary
4. Look at the eyes and the ears and make sure they are at the same level and symmetrical
5. State the following; “Facial features are in tact and symmetrical”

## Head Checks

Next, I can palpate the head

• Check for any masses, indentation, skin breakdown, and infestations (gloves should be worn)
• Any open or bleeding moles
• Any dandruff and note that the skin is flaky dry
• This can be done by moving the hair in one-inch increments looking for any flees or lice (there will be reddish areas)
• Feeling around for anything that is abnormal, as well as the hair color, texture, or patches that could be caused by alopecia

## Lymph Nodes

| Name of Location    | Physical Location          |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Pre-Auricular       | Front of the ear           |
| Post Auricular      | Back of the ear            |
| Occipital           | Back of the head           |
| Submandibular       | Bottom of mandible         |
| Submental           | Chin                       |
| Deep Cervical Chain | Follows the sterno muscles |
| Supraclavicular     | Shoulders                  |

1. Access the lymph nodes in the above areas, feeling for any hard lumps and tenderness. To check the Supraclavicular area, ask the patent to shrug their shoulders then palpate!
1. After checking all of the Lymph nodes state: “Lymph nodes noted but not palpable.”
1. Then doff your gloves and perform hand hygiene.

## Eye Checks

6. Eyes
   Looking at:
1. The corneas: shine the light on the side of the patient and the outer part should be translucent and clear of lesions
1. The sclera (the white of the eye)
1. Conjunctiva: pulling down the lower eyelids and making sure it is pink and moist
   • Looking at the general condition of the eyes
   • Are they blinking consistently and equal?
   • Do they look blood shot?
   • Are they watering?
   • Is there any strabismus?
   You shouldn’t see any swelling of the eyelids, the sclera shouldn’t be yellow which could be an indication of jaundice, conjunctiva should be pink and moist (shouldn’t be red or see any drainage)
   • PERRLA(pupils are round reactive to light accommodation)
   • Be sure to look at the direct and indirect responses. Each eye should constrict. Direct eye more than the indirect
   • Pupils should be 3-7 mm
   • Check for accommodation-(pen light test) have pt watch the pen-light and follow to the bridge of the nose (eyes should go towards eachother)
   • \*\*Then state that we concluded that the pupils were equal round and accommodating to light (PERRLA)

## Nose Checks

• From then you can look at the nose

- Make sure its symmetric in both and note any polyps or drainage
- Make sure the septum is intact, and that there is no septal deviation

## Ear Checks

Next you can look at the ears.

- Are there any abnormalities?
- Are they symmetrical?
- Redness
- Drainage
- Ask if they are having any pain in their ear
- Adults you put ears up and back while children are down and back

## Lip Checks

Next can access the lips

- Making sure they are proper color for their ethnicity
- Moist not chapped
- No sores on them
- Making sure they aren’t blue as that can repress their oxygen level
- Make sure the lips are symmetrical when they smile

## Mouth Checks

Inspect the inside of:
• Buccal mucosa: making sure it’s nice and pink
• Gums: check for any receding gums
• Tongue should be moist and pink not beefy red, no lesions or ulcerations
• Bad breath: halitosis

- You can lift the tongue and look for any lesions as mouth cancer can hide under there
- Look for cavities, dentures (note if they are upper or lower), or partial teeth and note where they are
- Make sure the uvula is nice and midline

10. Next can look at the neck and make sure that the trachea is midline and that there are no lumps

11. Next can look at the upper and lower extremities
    • Look for any lesions, swelling
    • Check for overall cleanliness of nails
    • Nails should be convex not concave (vitamin and iron deficiency)
    • Blanch test: checks for capillary refill
    • pressing down on the nail bed and then release it and that pink coloration should come back in less than 2 seconds, no more than 3
    Shamrock test: test for clubbing-(when a patient has been exposed to poor circulation over many years and in long term smokers)
    • Put finger beds together and look for an elongated diamond. If there was clubbing, they would not be able to touch
12. At that point you can start on their arms

- You would feel with the dorsal part of your hand and check their temperature and check moisture, and texture
- Make sure there is no swelling

13. You would want the skin to be dry, color pink (or pink underneath)
14. Go ahead and check the skin turgor by pulling the skin up and seeing if there is any tenting, there’s not, so skin turgor is intact
    At that point you can go ahead and check for edema (medical term for swelling)
15. There are two types of edemas
    • Pitting: can be in upper and lower extremities

- Take 2 of your finger pads and see if you make an indention over that swelling
- If you take your fingers off and it stays indented, that is pitting edema
  • Non pitting: they have an IV that came out of the vein causing the area of the arm to swell
  • Edema is measured 1+ to 4+
  • Mash down and indent 2 mm that’s 1 +, 2+ is 4 mm, 3+ is 6 mm, and 4+ 8 mm or more

Cranial nerves/Assessments:
I. Olfactory(sensory): patient smelling something-test with alcohol swab
II. Optic(sensory): checking visual acuity

- Near vision: Rosen bomb card. Have the patient hold it at arm’s length and see what the smallest line on it they can read
- Distant vision: Snellen chart: stand in a certain spot and have them read the lowest letters they can read. They can miss up to two letters
  **Nerves 3, 4, and 6 are tested together. This is where you will test the 6 cardinal signs of gaze(You don’t want to see extra ocular movements and no nystagmus (oscillating movements of the eyes)**
  ** nerves 9 and 10 are tested together**
  III. Oculomotor(motor)-eyes up and down
  IV. Trochlear(motor)-eyes invert towards nose
  V. Trigeminal: Has a sensory and motor component
- Motor: ask patient to clinch their teeth and put finger pads and put fingers near pre auricular lymph nodes and feel stop and sticking motions
- Sensory: close their eyes and take a cotton swap and touch somewhere on their head and ask where you are touching them
  VI. Abducens(motor)-lateral eye movement/side to side
  VII. Facial(motor): Smile, frown, puff out cheeks, raise eyebrows, looking for symmetry
  VIII. Vestibulocochlear (auditory or acoustic)
- Motor:
  • Romberg test
  • Start out with their feet together, eyes open and arms out to the side
  • Then you can ask them to do it with their eyes closed
  • It’s okay for them to sway a little bit but don’t want their feet to be out of stance
- Sensory:
  • Whisper test
  • Get to the side of the patient and whisper something and they need to repeat it
  IX. Glossopharyngeal (sensory and motor): gag reflex- use a cotton swab or tongue compressor to make them gag.
  X. Vagus(sensory and motor): longest cranial nerve. From the throat all the way to the stomach
- This is where you will have the patient say “ahh” and watch for the uvula to rise upward and should not deviate to one side
  XI. Spinal Accessory(motor): have patients shrug shoulders with and without resistance
  XII. Hypoglossal(motor): tongue movement. Ask them to stick their tongue in and out and then side to side
  **Can finish by saying cranial nerves 1-12 are intact**

Neuro assessment:
Test for Fine Motor Movements

1. Patient putting arms out to the side and ask them to take their index finger and touch their nose and then you ask them to go faster
2. Sit across from patient and ask them to touch their nose and they would touch your finger and then go faster
3. Supination and pronation while sitting up on their knee at the same time and then gradually go faster. Key is to do it at the same time not necessarily the rhythm
4. Thumb to fingers
5. If the patient can’t get out of bed you can ask them to take their opposite heel to the knee and slide it to the knee. It would go off to the side if they had an issue

Test for Gross Motor Movements
• Romberg
• Heel to toe
• Modified Romberg. Stand on one leg, bring their foot up to their knee, their arms out, and check their balance
